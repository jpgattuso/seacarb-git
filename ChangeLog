-----------------------------------
A series of additions from Mathilde Hagens (M.Hagens@uu.nl)

- New: carbfull, an extension of carb. Returns parameters of the seawater carbonate system, including the ammonium and sulfide acid-base systems, as well as full acid-base speciation. This function has not been tested very extensively.
- New: buffgen which returns the buffer factors of the seawater carbonate system as defined by Hagens and Middelburg (2016), the proton concentration buffer factor (beta.H of Hofmann et al, 2010) as well as the classic Revelle factor. This function has not been tested very extensively.
- New: K2si to calculate the second dissociation constant of Si(OH)4.
- Update: Pcoeffs and its help file now include K2si.
- Update: Pcorrect and its help file now include K2si.
- Update: kconv help file now lists the 6 conversion factors that the function returns (rather than only 3 before).
- Update: in Oa, the link to the "Guide to Best Practices for Ocean Acidification Research and Data Reporting" is to the OA-ICC instead of the EPOCA web site.

version 3.1.2, 2017-04-30
-----------------------------------
- New: added support of the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10). Added three optional parameters to functions carb, errors, derivnum, and all high-level routines that call carb: TEOS-10 option, longitude and latitude. Added functions eos2teos, teos2eos, sa2sp and sp2sa, all in one source file eos.R and one manual file (.Rd) for each. These additions are from Jean-Marie Epitalon.
- New eos2teos_chem function: Converts in situ temperature to conservative temperature and practical to absolute salinity based on total alkalinity as well as the concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon, nitrate and silicate
- New eos2teos_geo function: Converts in situ temperature to conservative temperature and practical to absolute salinity based on depth and geographic location. 
- New teos2eos_chem function: Converts conservative temperature to in situ temperature and absolute salinity to practical salinity based on total alkalinity as well as on the concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon, nitrate and silicate.
- New teos2eos_geo function: Converts conservative temperature to in situ temperature and absolute salinity to practical salinity based on depth and geographic location.
- New sa2sp_chem function: Converts from absolute to practical salinity based on total alkalinity as well as the concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon, nitrate and silicate
- New sa2sp_geo function: Converts from absolute (SA) to practical salinity (SP) based on depth and geographic location.
- New sp2sa_chem function: Converts from practical to absolute salinity based on total alkalinity as well as on the concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon, nitrate and silicate.
- New sp2sa_geo function: Converts from practical to absolute salinity based on depth and geographic location
- Fixed: following an alert message sent to all CRAN-package maintainers, fixed a bug related to vector "Pt" compared to scalar 0 in a "if" statement.

version 3.1.1, 2016-11-22
-----------------------------------
- Fixed: buffesm was returning NaNs when Pt=0 

version 3.1, 2016-11-18
-----------------------------------
New routines have been added to perform error propagation (errors.R) and to take numerical derivatives (derivnum.R) of carb's calculated output variables with respect to its input variables and constants. An existing routine that computes buffer factors (buffesm.R) has been improved. These additions are from Jean-Marie Epitalon and James Orr.

- New: errors.R function allows the user to choose to use either the standard approach (Gaussian error propagation),the method of moments, or the Monte Carlo approach. Results of the three approaches generally agree within 1% when the argument runs is set to 10000 (samples). But the Monte Carlo approach is more computationally intensive, requiring some seconds for each data point even less than 10000 runs. The Gaussian approach is the default.

- New: derivnum.R function is useful not only because it is used in the error propagation (Gaussian approach), but also because it computes partial derivatives of all output variables with respect to all input variables and constants; these sensitivities may also be referred to as buffer factors. The numerical approach has been refined to minimize error and its results agree extremely well with available analytical derivatives and mocsy's automatic derivatives which are as accurate as analytical derivatives. Thus the derivnum routine has been optimized and tested in many ways.

- New: 'buffesm.R' function has been improved to account for effects of total dissolved inorganic phosphorus (Pt) and silicon (Sit) on buffer factors and the Revelle factor. This is an advance relative to the original equations from Egleston et al (2010) who did not acount for effects from these nutrients (Orr and Epitalon, 2015).

- Updated: the default flag to calculate K1 and K2 when T is outside the range 2 to 35oC and/or S is outside the range 19 to 43 is "w14" (Waters et al., 2014).

- Fixed bug in carb: an error was returned when there were NA values for ALK with flags 13 and 15 (many thanks to Matthew A. Birk for reporting this bug and proposing a fix).

version 3.0.14, 2016-04-09
-----------------------------------
- Corrected a bug in Pcoeffs.txt which prevented to perform pressure corrections properly.

version 3.0.13, 2016-04-02
-----------------------------------
- Internal change: directory /data-raw deleted in response to the rejection of version 3.0.12.
- Updated the help file of some constants which did not indicate how pressure correction is performed.

version 3.0.12, 2016-04-01
-----------------------------------
- Pcoeffs, the coefficients used for pressure-correcting the equilibrium constants: internal location changed to suit the needs of a user. It should not affect anyone.
- This version was rejected by CRAN because the files used to store Pcoeffs in R/sysdata.rda were left in data-raw/

version 3.0.11, 2015-08-18
-----------------------------------
- Function ppH, pmix, pTA: fixed the output which was incorrect

version 3.0.10, 2015-08-17
-----------------------------------
- Function pCa: fixed the output which was incorrect (thanks to Steeve Comeau for letting me know!)

version 3.0.9, 2015-07-30
-----------------------------------
- Function K1 and K2: added the option to use the formaulation of Waters et al. (2014)
- Man files changed accordingly: K1.Rd, K2.Rd, Om.Rd, buffer.Rd, buffesm.Rd, carb.Rd, oa.Rd, pCa.Rd, pHinsi.Rd, pTA.Rd, pgas.Rd, pmix.Rd, ppH.Rd, psi.Rd

version 3.0.8, 2015-07-23
-----------------------------------
- Fixed function buffesm: James Orr fixed carb var indices, made consistent with seacarb 3.0+. 
- Removed carbm.Rd. carbm was removed in version 3.0.2 but the Rd file crept in again

version 3.0.7, 2015-05-06
-----------------------------------
- New function carbb: added an option to indicate the amount of boron added. THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL FUNCTION; USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

version 3.0.6, 2015-02-03
-----------------------------------
- Function carb: added "standard" as 3rd "gas" option for pCO2 input at in situ temperature and atmospheric pressure
- Function buffer: minor revision to accommodate the change in carb mentioned above.

version 3.0.5, 2015-01-06
-----------------------------------
- Function buffer: K0 is computed with potential T and atm pressure only (K0pot);
- Function buffer: the pH scale conversions are corrected as done previously (v3.0.4) in carb.R
- Function buffer: indices for variables from carb have been corrected (they differ in new version of carb).

version 3.0.4, 2015-01-05
-----------------------------------
- New function: tetha to compute potential temperature (corresponding help file added too)
- Function carb: added potential fCO2 and pCO2 (fCO2pot, pCO2pot) in the output
- Function carb: added a new option "gas" as an input argument as recommended by Orr & Epitalon (2015). It can be either 'insitu' or 'potential' (the default). For flags 21 to 25, this new option describes whether the input pCO2 that is given is "in situ" pCO2 or potential pCO2. For other flags, this input option is not used. In situ values are calculated after making pressure corrections to K0 and the fugacity coefficient following Weiss (1974) using total in situ pressure and in situ temperature. Potential values are calculated at 1 atm pressure while using potential instead of in situ temperature.
- Function carb: as a result of the change above, the carb function now uses the swTheta function of the oce package which therefore needs to be installed.
- Function carb: corrected errors in pH scale conversion and fCO2 to pCO2 conversion
- Functions carb, buffer, buffesm and Ks: removed unused variables ION and iom0
- Function Kf: fixed erroneous equation using wrong ionic strength (replaced ION with iom0) 
- Changed data set Pcoeffs.txt: changed 'a0' for Kspa from -46.00 to -45.96, consitent with literature
- Function rho: convert input T (ITS 90) to T (IPTS 68) and then compute density, as intended
- Functions Ks, Pcorrect, at, buffer, buffesm, kconv, pHconv: more accurate Ft equation and clearer St equation (best practices)
- Function Kb: refined pH scale conversion
- Functions K1, K2 and carb: corrected errors in pH scale conversion
- Corrected English

version 3.0.3, 2014-12-10
-----------------------------------
- Changed the formulation for the concentration of boron from Lee et al. (2000) to Upstrom (1974), as recommended by Orr and Epitalon (2014)
- Corrected a bug introduced in the carb function of v3.0.2
- The changes below clarify the changes described for v3.0.2
- Fugacity coefficient (for fCO2 <-> pCO2 conversion) modified: (1) changed the gas constant R to use the correct units (as in Weiss (1974); (2) included the "x2" term in Weiss (1974); (3) accounted for total pressure (Ptot = atmospheric + hydrostatic) as in Weiss (1974) instead of assuming Ptot = 1 atm
- K0 modified: added the pressure correction term in Weiss (1974).

version 3.0.2, 2014-11-17
-----------------------------------
- Functions carb and buffer now have an extra setting: Patm, the atmospheric pressure in atm
- Added three new functions written by James Orr: vapress, x2pCO2 and p2xCO2.
- James Orr also added pressure correction to K0, using Weiss (1974, equation 5)
- James Orr corrected an error in the fugacity coefficient
- Removed function carbex
- Removed function carbm which will be rewritten on par with carb IF it is useful to someone

version 3.0.1, 2014-08-19
-----------------------------------
- Pt and Sit are set to 0 if NA (in all functions where these variables are used except carbex and carbm)
- Improved citation information

version 3.0, 2014-03-06
-----------------------------------
1- Major update led by Jean-Marie Epitalon, who has become a coauthor of the package.

2- Speed optimisation of the computation of dissociation constants by (1) using vectors rather than loops and (2) passing optional parameters. The increase in speed is up to 35x.

3- Computation of dissociation constants:
- One or two pHScale conversion factor(s) are passed as optional parameter(s) to speed-up computation: (i) kSWS2scale to convert from the seawater scale (SWS) to the pH scale selected at the hydrostatic pressure value indicated and (ii) ktotal2SWS_P0 to convert from the total scale to the SWS at an hydrostatic pressure of 0.These conversion factors are calculated using function kconv() if they are not given.
- Computations are vectorized rather than using loops.
- Warning messages for out-of-validity-domain: only one message per constant (instead of one per data entry).

4- Pressure correction function Pcorrect:
- Two pHScale conversion factors are passed as optional parameters to speed-up computation: (i) kconv2Scale to convert from the pH scale selected to the SWS (or free for Kf) scale at the hydrostatic pressure value indicated and (ii) kconv2ScaleP0 to convert from pH scale selected to the SWS (or free for Kf) scale at the hydrostatic pressure value indicated. These conversion factors are calculated using function kconv() if they are not given.
- Computations are vectorized rather than using loops

5- pH scale conversion kconv:
- Two dissociation constants passed as optional parameters to speed-up computation: Ks and Kff, which is Kf on the free pH scale

6- All these optional parameters not only allow faster calculations, they also allow more precise computation since the pHscale conversions are now based on the Ks and Kf values calculated as selected by the user (Dickson or Khoo for Ks, Perez & Fragra or Dickson & Goyet for Kf). In a previous version, an attempt has been made to remember Kf formulation choice but it does not support the case of data set with different choice for each entry.

7- carb function:
- Instead of looping though data: processing is made in batches
- For each particular value f of flag, a subset of all data is created based on flag=f, then this subset is processed in one shot
- When the Taylor approximation algorithm is used (call to uniroot()), a loop iteration over data is still used
- Dissociation constants Kxy: for each Kxy, a vector of values for all data is computed at the beginning in one shot; there is only one call to the function Kxy()
- When flag=8, the approximation of DIC by the Taylor algorithm is replaced by direct computation as DIC is linearly dependent on carbonate alkalinity.

8- buffer function: computations are vectorized rather than using loops.

9- Kf now uses a correct formulation for ionic strength.

-----------------------------------
version 2.4.10, 2013-04-17
- Added function carbex to experiment potential future changes. DO NOT USE this function

-----------------------------------
version 2.4.9, 2013-03-11
- Replaced Kh by K0, the right symbol for the solubility of carbon dioxide in sea water. Many functions and help files were changed.
- The range of salinity for K1 and K2 according to Roy et al. (1993) was wrong (0-45). The correct range of salinity (5-45) is now used. Several functions, including K1 and K2, and their help files were changed.

-----------------------------------
version 2.4.8, 2013-02-22
The previous version 2.4.7 was rejected by CRAN. This version is an attempt to fix two issues. There are no bug fix nor new capabilities.

-----------------------------------
version 2.4.7, 2013-01-18 [not distributed through CRAN which rejected it]
Thanks to James Orr for identifying the errors below and providing corrected code for all the routines mentioned.
- Corrected a bug in the calculation of Kf, the stability constant of hydrogen fluoride, according to Dickson and Goyet (1994)[flag kf="dg"]. The effect on computed results is negligible.
- Corrected a bug in the pressure correction of Ksi, the dissociation constant of Si(OH)4. The coefficient a2 had the wrong sign. There is no impact on surface values; small but significant differences will be found for deep samples where Si concentrations are substantial.
- Modified calculations of Kw, K1p, K2p, K3p and Ksi to use the exact method to convert each constant from the seawater to the total scale instead of the approximation that simply subtracts 0.015 (Dickson et al., 2007, Chapter 5, page 14, footnote 5). That "constant" now varies from 0.000 to 0.032, but the impact on computed results are quite small (as are differences between the Seawater and Total scales)
- Made minor changes to Kf and kconv for consistent recovery of the kf option.

-----------------------------------
version 2.4.6, 2012-12-12
- Corrected a small bug which prevented to use function K2 with a vector.

-----------------------------------

-----------------------------------
version 2.4.4, 2012-06-26
- Modification on Pcorrect to optimise processing speed.
- New function zzz.R which loads Pcoeff when package is loaded.

-----------------------------------

- added function "pgas" which calculates the carbonate chemistry after changes in pCO2 generated by gas bubbling
- added function "pmix" which calculates the carbonate chemistry after mixing of two water samples with different pCO2
- added function "ppH" which calculates the carbonate chemistry after pH manipulations through addition of acid or base
- added function "pTA" which calculates the carbonate chemistry following addition of CO3 or HCO3
- carb function modified to return only S, T, P, pH, pCO2, fCO2, HCO3, CO3, DIC, ALK, OmegaAragonite and OmegaCalcite.
- added function "buffer" which calculates the buffer parameters of the seawater carbonate system. 
- carb function modified in order to closely follow the recommendations of the "Guide to Best Practices for Ocean CO2 Measurements" (Dickson et al., 2007). Phosphate ans ilicate concentrations are now taken into account.
- K1 function uses the equation of Lueker et al. (2000) by default
- K2 function uses the equation the method of Lueker et al. (2000) by default
- Kf function uses, by default, the equation of Perez and Fraga (1987). The equation of Dickson and Roy can be used with the argument kf = 'dg'.

--------------------------
