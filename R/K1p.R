    # From J. C. Orr on 15 Jan 2013:
    # The formulation above was a modified version of Millero (1995) where Dickson et al. (2007) subtracted 0.015
    # from Millero's original constant (115.54) to give 115.525 (the 2nd term above). BUT Dickson's reason for that 
    # operation was to "convert--approximately--from theSWS pH scale (including HF) used by Millero (1995) to the 'total' 
    # scale ...". 
    # This subtraction of 0.015 to switch from the SWS to Total scale is not good for 2 reasons:
    # (1) The 0.015 value is inexact (not constant), e.g., it is 0.022 at T=25, S=35, P=0;
    # (2) It makes no sense to switch to the Total scale when just below you switch back to the SWS scale.
    # The best solution is to reestablish the original equation (SWS scale) and delete the subsequent scale conversion.

    # now the original formulation: Millero (1995)
