# One adds a certain volume (vol) of HCl (vol  is then negative) or NaOH (vol is then positive) to 1 kg of seawater. 
# vol is in liter
# N is the normality of the HCl or NaOH
# HCl or NaOH are, respectively, a strong acid and a strong base which are therefore fully dissociated. The concentration of H+ or OH- is N mole/l
# HCl 1N: 0.1 ml therefore adds 0.1 e-3 mol of H+, decreasing TA
# NaOH 1N: 0.1 ml therefore adds 0.1 e-3 mol of OH-, increasing TA
# DIC is constant in a closed system
