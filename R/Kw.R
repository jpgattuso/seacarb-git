    #tmp1 = -13847.26/TK + 148.9652 - 23.6521 * log(TK); ## second term is 148.9652 as given in Dickson (2007) instead of 148.96502 as recommanded in DOE (1994). 

    # From J. C. Orr on 15 Jan 2013:
    # The formulation above was a modified version of Millero (1995) where Dickson et al. (2007) subtracted 0.015
    # from Millero's original constant (148.9802) to give 148.9652 (the 2nd term above). BUT Dickson's reason for that 
    # operation was to "convert--approximately--from theSWS pH scale (including HF) used by Millero (1995) to the 'total' 
    # scale ...". 
    # This subtraction of 0.015 to switch from the SWS to Total scale is not good for 2 reasons:
    # (1) The 0.015 value is inexact (not constant), e.g., it is 0.022 at T=25, S=35, P=0;
    # (2) It makes no sense to switch to the Total scale when just below you switch back to the SWS scale.
    # The best solution is to reestablish the original equation (SWS scale) and delete the subsequent scale conversion.

    tmp1 = -13847.26/TK + 148.9802 - 23.6521 * log(TK); # now the original formulation: Millero (1995)

    Kw  = exp(lnKw);
