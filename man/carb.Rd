	\item{var2}{Value of the second  variable in mol/kg, except for pH}
	\item{S}{Salinity}
	\item{T}{Temperature in degrees Celsius}

  \item{k1k2}{"l" for using K1 and K2 from Lueker et al. (2000), "m06" from Millero et al. (2006), "m10" from Millero (2010), "w14" from Waters et al. (2014), and "r" from Roy et al. (1993).

  \item{gas}{used to indicate the convention for INPUT pCO2, i.e., when it is an input variable (flags 21 to 25): "insitu" indicates it is referenced to in situ pressure and in situ temperature; "potential" indicates it is referenced to 1 atm pressure and potential temperature; and "standard" indicates it is referenced to 1 atm pressure and in situ temperature. All three options should give identical results at surface pressure. This option is not used when pCO2 is not an input variable (flags 1 to 15). The default is "potential".}

}

\details{The Lueker et al. (2000) constants for K1 and K2, the Perez and Fraga (1987) constant for Kf and the Dickson (1990) constant for Ks are recommended by Dickson et al. (2007). It is, however, critical to consider that each formulation is only valid for specific ranges of temperature and salinity:

\emph{For K1 and K2:}
\itemize{
\item Roy et al. (1993): S ranging between 5 and 45 and T ranging between 0 and 45oC.

\item Lueker et al. (2000): S ranging between 19 and 43 and T ranging between 2 and 35oC.

\item Millero et al. (2006): S ranging between 0.1 and 50 and T ranging between 1 and 50oC.

\item Millero (2010): S ranging between 1 and 50 and T ranging between 0 and 50oC. Millero (2010) provides a K1 and K2 formulation for the seawater, total and free pH scales. Therefore, when this method is used and if P=0, K1 and K2 are computed with the formulation corresponding to the pH scale given in the flag "pHscale". 
}

\emph{For Kf:}
\itemize{
\item Perez and Fraga (1987): S ranging between 10 and 40 and T ranging between 9 and 33oC.

\item Dickson and Riley (1979 in Dickson and Goyet, 1994): S ranging between 0 and 45 and T ranging between 0 and 45oC.
}

\emph{For Ks:}
\itemize{
\item Dickson (1990): S ranging between 5 and 45 and T ranging between 0 and 45oC.

\item Khoo et al. (1977): S ranging between 20 and 45 and T ranging between 5 and 40oC.
}

The arguments can be given as a unique number or as vectors. If the lengths of the vectors are different, the longer vector is retained and only the first value of the other vectors is used. It is recommended to use either vectors with the same dimension or one vector for one argument and numbers for the other arguments.

\emph{Pressure corrections and pH scale:}

\itemize{
\item For K0, the pressure correction term of Weiss (1974) is used.

\item For K1, K2, pK1, pK2, pK3, Kw, Kb, Khs and Ksi, the pressure correction was applied on the seawater scale. Hence, if needed, values were first transformed from the total scale to the seawater scale, the pressure correction applied as described by Millero (1995), and the value was transformed back to the required scale (T, F or SWS).

\item For Kf, the pressure correction was applied on the free scale. The formulation of Dickson and Riley (1979 in Dickson and Goyet, 1994) provides Kf on the free scale but that of Perez and Fraga (1987) provides it on the total scale. Hence, in that case, Kf was first transformed from the total scale to the free scale. With both formulations, the pressure correction was applied as described by Millero (1995), and the value was transformed back to the required scale (T, F or SWS). 

\item For Ks, the pressure correction was applied on the free scale. The pressure correction was applied as described by Millero (1995), and the value was transformed back to the required scale (T, F or SWS). 

\item For Kn, The pressure correction was applied on the seawater scale. The pressure correction was applied as described by Millero (1995), and the value was transformed back to the required scale (T, F or SWS).
