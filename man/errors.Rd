\details{
This function requires users to specify each input uncertainty as either
the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean. The latter
implies much smaller propagated uncertainties, but is appropriate only
when interested in the error in the mean, not the error of a given
measurement. Beware that it is easy to fool oneself when using the
standard error of the mean rather than the standard deviation.

This function requires different types of uncertainties:
\itemize{
\item absolute uncertainties for evar1, evar2, eS, eT, ePt, eSit (same units as the input data, e.g., mol/kg);
\item uncertainties in pK units for epK; and
\item uncertainties in relative fractional units (between 0.0 and 1.0) for eBt.
}

This function propagates uncertainties from input to output variables using one of three methods: 
\itemize{
\item Gaussian:
     The Gaussian method is the standard technique for estimating a
     computed variable's (z) second moment (its variance or standard
     deviation) based on a first-order approximation to z.  More
     precisely, we use here the basic 1st order, 2nd moment
     uncertainty analysis (a type of Taylor expansion), assuming no
     covariance between input variables.  This is the approach used by
     Dickson and Riley (1978). It is the default method.

\item Method of moments: The method of moments is a more general form
     of the Gaussian method. But in addition, it also accounts for
     covariance between input variables.  In this case, the 'errors'
     routine allows the user to specify a value of the correlation
     coefficient 'r', having a value between -1.0 and 1.0, to indicate
     the correlation between uncertainties of the input pair of
     carbonate system variables. That correlation is used to comput
     the covariance. But by default, it is assumed that there is no
     covariance (r=0.0).

\item Monte Carlo:
     The Monte Carlo method is a brute-force approach relying on
     repeated random sampling of input errors, adding those to each
     input variables, calculating the corresponding output variables
     for each sample, and finally assessing the standard deviation in
     each output variables.
}

This function has many input parameters that are identical to those
in the carb function. For their details, refer to the 'carb' documentation.

All parameters may be scalars or vectors except epK, eBt, method, runs, and gas.

\itemize{
  \item runs and eBt must be scalars
  \item method and gas must each consist of a character string
  \item epK may be a vector of 7 values. In that case, it must list errors for 
    pK0, pK1, pK2, pKb, pKw, pKspa and pKspc, respectively.
    That set of errors is identical for all input data.
    Alternatively, users may specify 'epK=NULL' or 'epK=0' to set all 7 values to zero
    and thus neglect errors in the equilibrium constants. 
}
In constrast, for evar1, evar2, r, eS, eT, ePt and eSit:

\itemize{
  \item  if they are vectors, they represent errors associated with each data point
  \item  if they are scalars (single real numbers), they represent one error value each associated to all data points
}

The same remark applies to parameter r (correlation coefficient).

long and lat are used as conversion parameters from absolute to practical salinity: when seawater is not of standard composition, practical salinity alone is not sufficient to compute absolute salinity and vice-versa. One needs to know the density. When long and lat are given, density is inferred from WOA silicate concentration at given location. When they are not, an arbitrary geographic point is chosen: mid equatorial Atlantic. Note that this implies an error on computed salinity up to 0.02 g/kg.
}

\section{Correlation coefficient}{
By default, 'r' is zero. However, for some pairs the user may want to specify a different value. For example, measurements of pCO2 and pH are often anti-correlated. The same goes for two other pairs: 'CO2 and CO3' and 'pCO2 and CO3'.  But even for these cases, care is needed before using non-zero values of 'r'.

When the user wishes to propagate errors for an individual measurement, 'r' should ALWAYS be zero if each member of the input pair is measured independently. In this case, we are interested in the correlation between the uncertainties in those measurements, not in the correlation between the measurements themselves. Uncertainties from those measurements are probably not correlated if they come from different instruments. Conversely, if users are interested in the error in the mean of a distribution of measurements (i.e., if they are propagating standard errors instead of standard deviations), one should then also account for the correlation between the measurements of the two variables of the input pair.

For input pairs where one member is pH (flags 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 21), this 'errors' function automatically inverses the sign of 'r'. The reason for that is that the associated derivatives are computed in terms of the hydrogen ion concentration (H+), not pH. Therefore for each of these 6 flags, if the user wants to compute their own 'r' that should be done by (1) using the H+ concentration instead of pH, and (2) inversing the sign of that computed 'r' before passing it as an argument to this routine. Usually though (when not calculating r for pH), the user may just use the 'r' in the expected way.  For example, to include the covariance term when there is a perfect anticorrelation of pH with pCO2, one would use 'r=-1.0'.

}

\section{Computation time}{
Computation time depends on the method chosen; the Monte Carlo method takes much longer to execute. The computational time required for the Monte Carlo method is proportional to the number of runs. More runs, implies improved accuracy: runs = 10000 appears a minimum to obtain an accuracy of less than 1\%. Accuracy is inversely proportional to the number of runs.

Computation time also depends on the chosen pair of input variables. For example, with the input pair DIC and Total alkalinity (flag=15), it is much longer than for input pair pH and Total alkalinity (flag=8)
}

\value{The function returns a 2-dimensional dataframe, with the following columns:
 \itemize{
 \item{H}{total error in [H+] concentration (mol/kg)}
 \item{pH}{total error in pH}
 \item{CO2}{total error in CO2 concentration (mol/kg)}
 \item{pCO2}{total error in "standard" pCO2, CO2 partial pressure computed at in situ temperature and atmospheric pressure (\eqn{\mu}atm)}
 \item{fCO2}{total error in "standard" fCO2, CO2 fugacity computed at in situ temperature and atmospheric pressure (\eqn{\mu}atm)}
 \item{HCO3}{total error in HCO3 concentration (mol/kg)}
 \item{CO3}{total error in CO3 concentration (mol/kg)}
 \item{DIC}{total error in DIC concentration (mol/kg)}
 \item{ALK}{total error in ALK, total alkalinity (mol/kg)}
 \item{OmegaAragonite}{total error in Omega aragonite (aragonite saturation state)}
 \item{OmegaCalcite}{total error in Omega calcite   (calcite saturation state)}
}
 
If all input data have the same 'flag' value, the returned data frame does not show errors on input pair of carbonate system variables. For example, if all input flags are 15, the input pair is DIC and ALK; hence, errors on DIC and ALK are not returned.
