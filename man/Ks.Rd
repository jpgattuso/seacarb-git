\description{Stability constant of hydrogen sulfate (mol/kg)}
\usage{
Ks(S=35, T=25, P=0, ks="d", warn="y")
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{S}{Salinity, default is 35}
  \item{T}{Temperature in degrees Celsius, default is 25oC}
  \item{P}{Hydrostatic pressure in bar (surface = 0), default is 0}
  \item{ks}{"d" for using Ks from Dickson (1990), "k" for using Ks from Khoo et al. (1977), default is "d"} 
  \item{warn}{"y" to show warnings when T or S go beyond the valid range for Ks; "n" to supress warnings. The default is "y".}
}

\details{The Dickson (1990) constant is recommended by Guide to Best Practices for Ocean CO2 Measurements (2007). It is, however, critical to consider that each formulation is only valid for specific ranges of temperature and salinity:

\itemize{
\item Dickson (1990): S ranging between 5 and 45 and T ranging between 0 and 45oC.

\item Khoo et al. (1977): S ranging between 20 and 45 and T ranging between 5 and 40oC.
}

Note that the arguments can be given as a unique number or as vectors. If the lengths of the vectors are different, the longer vector is retained and only the first value of the other vectors is used. It can therefore be critical to use vectors of the same length. 

The pressure correction is applied on the free scale as described by Millero (1995), and the value transformed back to the required scale (T, F or SWS).
